# Project Title

A full stack web application that utilizes React.js, Next.js, Golang, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3.

## Description

This project aims to provide a cloud-based file hosting service that allows one to upload and retrieve images and videos. Similarly to application like Google Drive or Dropbox, this app features the ability to manage user media with a focus on easily accessing media links.
Building this project was my way to further my skills in full stack development, specifically familizarizing myself with using Golang.
